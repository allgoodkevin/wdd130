    <p> Hi Iâ€™m Kevin Allgood from Delaware. I live here with my wife Katie and 3 kids, Jordan 9, Noah 6, Abbie 4. We
        also have custody of my 16 year old niece Savannah. I lived in Maryland for the last 20 years and moved about 45
        min south and east to Delaware. Prior to that though we spent 8 months in Indianapolis. Born in Upstate NY and
        raised just west across the Lake in Michigan, I love the northern parts of America. One of my favorite spot is
        Mackinaw Island and Upstate Michigan. I love cars, motorcycles and things that go fast so naturally I love Fast
        and Furious movies. </p>
